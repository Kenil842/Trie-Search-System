apple, banana, journey, majestic, sunset, wonder, beautiful, tranquility, courage, strength, 
Dream big and dare to fail, The early bird catches the worm, A penny saved is a penny earned, 
Patience is a virtue, Honesty is the best policy, A friend in need is a friend indeed, 
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade, Actions speak louder than words, 
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, Rome wasnot built in a day, 
The grass is always greener on the other side, Better late than never, 
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, Fortune favors the bold, 
The pen is mightier than the sword, Absence makes the heart grow fonder, 
You can not judge a book by its cover, Every cloud has a silver lining, 
Donot count your chickens before they hatch, Knowledge is power, 
apple, courage, honesty, kindness, empathy, wisdom, patience, kindness, serenity, 
Life is a journey, not a destination, A rolling stone gathers no moss, 
Donot put all your eggs in one basket, If it ainot broke, donot fix it, 
Beggars can not be choosers, When it rains, it pours, Curiosity killed the cat, 
A watched pot never boils, Good things come to those who wait, Time heals all wounds, 
The best things in life are free, Actions speak louder than words, Practice makes perfect, 
You reap what you sow, The squeaky wheel gets the grease, A picture is worth a thousand words, 
apple, dream, honesty, gratitude, mountain, ocean, flower, sunlight, journey, strength, 
It is always darkest before the dawn, There is no place like home, Better safe than sorry, 
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread, Birds of a feather flock together, 
A stitch in time saves nine, Donot bite the hand that feeds you, 
All that glitters is not gold, Blood is thicker than water, Rome wasnot built in a day, 
Barking up the wrong tree, can not see the forest for the trees, Cross that bridge when you come to it, 
Actions speak louder than words, A penny for your thoughts, The apple doesnot fall far from the tree, 
Two heads are better than one, Ignorance is bliss, It takes two to tango, Let sleeping dogs lie, 
Look before you leap, Money doesnot grow on trees, A fool and his money are soon parted, 
apple, honesty, patience, journey, flower, sunset, ocean, mountain, 
Out of sight, out of mind, Actions speak louder than words, All that glitters is not gold, 
Too many cooks spoil the broth, If you can not beat them, join them, Donot cry over spilled milk, 
The best of both worlds, Burn the midnight oil, Every dog has its day, Once bitten, twice shy, 
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, You can not have your cake and eat it too, 
To each their own, There is no time like the present, An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, 
The ball is in your court, Bite the bullet, Break the ice, 
At the drop of a hat, Bend over backwards, Call it a day, apple, courage, honesty, 
patience, wisdom, kindness, bravery, dream, flower, gratitude, freedom, journey,

Blessing in disguise, Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, Birds of a feather flock together, 
Catch-22, a double-edged sword, Back to the drawing board, Cloud nine, High on life, On cloud nine, 
Fingers crossed, Piece of cake, Through thick and thin, Tongue-in-cheek, The whole nine yards, 
Keep your chin up, Break a leg, Burn bridges, Chew the fat, Apple, Orange, Dream, 
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, She sells seashells by the seashore, A rolling stone gathers no moss, 
Donot bite off more than you can chew, Donot cry over spilled milk, Donot put all your eggs in one basket, 
Hit the nail on the head, Let bygones be bygones, Life is like a box of chocolates, apple, honesty, 
An arm and a leg, Burn the midnight oil, Caught between a rock and a hard place, Go down in flames,
